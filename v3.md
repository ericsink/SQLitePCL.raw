# SQLitePCLRaw 3.0 Release Notes

## What's NOT new?

- There are no code changes in SQLitePCLRaw.core.  
- The only code changes in the providers are related to support for encryption builds.
- If you use SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3, the upgrade to 3.0 should Just Work.

## What's new?

- Support for classic Xamarin has been removed.
- A new package called SQLitePCLRaw.config.e_sqlite3 has been added.  This is identical to .bundle_e_sqlite3, except with no dependency on a native SQLite lib package, thus allowing the flexibility to choose a different one.
- For backward compatibility, .bundle_e_sqlite3 is still supported, and has been redefined to be nothing more than two package dependencies: .config.e_sqlite3 and .lib.e_sqlite3.
- The version number of the SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3 package now matches the version of SQLite used to build it, not the version of SQLitePCLRaw.  In general, I will no longer increment the version number of SQLitePCLRaw just to incorporate an updated SQLite version.
- My recommended solution for SQLite encrypton is now the SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE), available from the SQLite core team.
- SourceGear (my company) is now offering paid serices around .NET and SQLite, including technical support agreements, maintenance of SQLite builds with a private nuget server, and custom software development.
- I no longer distribute any no-cost SQLite builds with encryption.  SQLCipher builds are available for purchase from Zetetic, and I will continue to coordinate with them to ensure compatibility.  Builds for SEE and SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers are available as part of SourceGear's SQLite build service.
- The SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_green package has been removed.  It provided a configuration which was too weird to make convenient.  I'll talk with the maintainer of sqlite-net about the best way forward.
- The SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3mc and provider.e_sqlite3mc packages have been removed.  The sqlite3mc builds from SourceGear's build service use `e_sqlite3` as their base name and are compatible with .config.e_sqlite3.
- The SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_zetetic package has been removed.  The corresponding provider is still supported.
- The SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_sqlite3 and bundle_winsqlite3 packages have been removed.  Each of them was an entire package for one line of code.  The corresponding providers are still supported.
- The targeted version of .NET Framework has changed from 4.6.2 to 4.7.1.
- The default provider for .NET Framework has been changed back to using DLLImport (which worked well) instead of using dynamic loading (which caused more sadness than joy).
