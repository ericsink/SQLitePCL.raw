# SQLitePCLRaw

SQLitePCLRaw is a .NET Portable Class Library (PCL) for low-level (raw)
access to SQLite.

This library is open source (Apache License v2) and has been downloaded
hundreds of millions of times on nuget.org.

My name is Eric Sink.  I am:

- the maintainer of this library
- the founder of SourceGear, a small software company in Illinois
- part of the SQLite core team

You can email me at either eric@sourcegear.com or eric@sqlite.org.
Please contact me if you are interested in any of the following
related services available from SourceGear:

## Technical Support

SourceGear offers technical support agreements at various price levels.

## SQLite builds

SourceGear operates a paid service at nuget.sourcegear.com
which provides various native SQLite builds which are
updated immediately after each SQLite release.  These include regular
SQLite builds, or various options with encryption support.  We can also provide
custom configurations.

## Encryption support

I no longer publish encryption-enabled SQLite builds without cost.

My recommended solution for encryption support is the SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE), which is the official implementation from the SQLite team:

https://sqlite.org/com/see.html

The SEE is not open source -- a paid license is required.  SourceGear's SQLite build service
provides SEE builds in the form of nuget packages.

## Custom software development

SourceGear offers custom software devlopment or maintenance services
on a time-and-materials basis.
