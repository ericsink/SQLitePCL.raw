This is a Windows Store Unit Test project for the Portable Class Library for SQLite v3.8.3.1

In order to build and run the project, verify that the extension SDK SQLite for Windows Runtime v3.8.3.1, from the SQLite.org site (http://www.sqlite.org/2014/sqlite-winrt-3080301.vsix), has been properly installed.
When targeting x64 platform architecture, you should verify that the Default Processor Architecture option is set to X64 (Test -> Test Settings).
